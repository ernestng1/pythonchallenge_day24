<h1>Day 24 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 24 challenge, I created a Snake Game (that incorporates a high score list) and a Mail Merge project that takes in a list of names and creates personalised messages automatically. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Files, Path and Directories</li>
  <li>Reading, writing and appending of txt files using Python</li>
  <li>Conditional statements - if/else</li>
</ul>

> [!TIP]
> Through the Mail Merge project, I learned how to automate many processes that used to require alot of manual work (i.e., inputting of names one by one). While I understand that there are existing softwares available that allows one to create and send personalised emails to the masses, it is fun to be able to develop it from scratch and I believe the ability to code it out provides a form of autonomy (i.e., being able to code for specific situations). I can already see  potential use cases such as generating standardised appeals letters based on information provided.

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>
