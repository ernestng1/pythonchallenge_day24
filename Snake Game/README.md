<h1>Day 20 and 21 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 20 and 21 challenge, I created a Snake Game (where you control as snake using the ASWD key, eat food to grow longer and try to avoid hitting the boundaries and any segments of the snake itself). This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming: Turtle and Screen Library</li>
  <li>Splicing of Tuples</li>
  <li>Class Inheritance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
